CRAFTING YOUR DESCRIPTIONS
Adapted from South Dakota State University Office of Career Development; includes content from
http://artsbridge.com/how-can-a-theatre-major-prepare-you-for-success/
Students often lament a perceived lack of experience, struggle to make connections between their experiences and what
is required in a job description or worry about how experiences in one realm (e.g., independent research) translate into
another (e.g., an industry internship). To allay those fears, use this three-step worksheet to (1) identify your transferable skills
or the skills listed in a specific job description (2) note where those skills were learned/developed, and (3) turn these general
concepts into Action-Oriented Accomplishment Statements.
Step 1: Identify your transferable skills
Place a check mark next to each skill you possess. Think about all settings in which you may have used/developed each skill.
Then, circle the ones you consider to be your top 10.
Communication & Creativity Leadership Teamwork
Writing clearly and concisely Managing and supervising groups Generating and initiating ideas
Listening attentively Delegating responsibility Making decisions with others
Expressing ideas Promoting and adapting to change Respecting others
Using media to present ideas Prioritizing tasks Developing rapport
Reporting information Identifying areas for improvement Sharing credit/cooperation
Public speaking Facilitating meetings Interacting effectively
Making presentations Coaching/mentoring/counseling Collaborating in diverse or
multicultural environment
Describing feelings Evaluating progress
Meeting team expectations
Improvising Giving praise and credit
Perceiving feelings, situations
Doing more with less Setting and accomplishing goals
Listening to others
Appreciating diversity Eliciting input and providing
Providing accurate descriptions feedback
Problem-Solving Research General Work
Anticipating potential problems Forecasting/predicting Setting and meeting deadlines
Defining problems and possible Designing an experiment Accepting responsibility
causes Imagining alternatives Enlisting help
Identifying and selecting solutions Identifying resources Editing/proofing
Creating innovative approaches Extracting important information Negotiating/persuading
Involving group members in Defining needs Seeking opportunities for
problem-solving professional growth
Development strategies
Developing plans to implement Taking initiative
Formulating conclusions
solutions Managing time and stress
Conceptualizing ideas
Establishing general principles Responding well to feedback
Observing and discovering
Teaching/training others Remaining calm under pressure
Analyzing information
Solving problems/mediating
Presenting findings
Implementing sound decisions
Learning new tools/techniques

Step 2: Brainstorm examples of how you used each skill
Use this template to list your top 10 skills in the far-left column, then note the place(s) where you demonstrated each skill.
Do not sweat the details here, you’ll get to that in Step 3. Although the example below illustrates a skill in use across all
three categories, some of your specific skills may have only be used on one or two.
Campus and Community
Employment & Course Projects
Transferable Skill
Activities
Internship Experiences & Research
Example: End of summer presentation Group presentation in class Submitted proposal for
Public speaking to department staff last semester campus-wide event
Step 3: Bring it all together with an accomplishment statement
Turn these general concepts into bullet points on your resume. You can ACE this part of resume-writing by starting with an
Action Verb to show you did something, providing the Context for that action using quantitative and qualitative terms and
then demonstrating the End Result of your actions to show the value of your contributions.
Action Verb Context End Result
Example: idea for a “Princeton Popcorn” night to and ultimately created an event which attracted
Pitched the Undergraduate Student Government 300+ attendees to a 2-day student-run film festival.

ACTION-ORIENTED
ACCOMPLISHMENT STATEMENTS
Showcasing what you’ve done and why it mattered is the best way to ACE resume writing! Start with an Action Verb to show
you did something. Then provide the Context for that action using quantitative and qualitative terms. Lastly, demonstrate the
End Result of your actions to show the value of your contributions!
