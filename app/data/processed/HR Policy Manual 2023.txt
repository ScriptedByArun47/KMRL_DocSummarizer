CHAPTER 1
GENERAL
IIMA- BRIEF NOTE
Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad [IIMA], was set up by the Government of India in
collaboration with the Government of Gujarat and local industrialists as an autonomous Institute
in 1961. IIMA has been conceived not only as a business school but also as a management institute.
IIMA builds on over five decades of excellence and leadership in management education.
IIMA has been rated as India’s best and Asia’s foremost Business School. IIMA continues to be
ranked as one of the finest institutions in the world in management education, with an academic
rigour that matches the top league. With a distinguished faculty, an exceptional student-faculty
ratio, and a 100-acre world-class campus conducive to continuous learning, IIMA is an Institute
that sets international standards in the field of management education.
IIMA, is a pioneer of the case study approach to management education in India, the result of its
early collaboration with Harvard Business School. A student-centred methodology entails working
in groups and encourages intense participation, as students learn to present their perspectives,
defend their stand, and think through management problems.
The Institute stands for excellence in management education. Since its inception, IIMA has
contributed to the development of management thought in India through its research and
teaching. In 2008, IIMA became the first management school in the country to be awarded EQUIS
(European Quality Improvement System) accreditation by the EFMD (European Foundation for
Management Development).
The Institute conducts the following major programmes:
1. Two-year Post Graduate Programme in Management (MBA).
2. Two-year Post Graduate Programme in Food and Agri-business Management (MBA - FABM).
3. Ph.D. Programme in Management.
4. One-year Post Graduate Programme in Management for Executives (MBA - PGPX).
5. Faculty Development Programme for Teachers in Universities and Colleges (FDP).
6. Armed Forces Programme for Officers for Indian Armed Forces (AFP).

simulation games, lecture-cum-discussions, role plays, project works and presentations by
participants.

actions against the concerned employee in addition to the debiting of half-a-day’s Casual
Leave to his account.

remain absent from duty without informing or prior permission of the concerned authority.
Such unauthorised absence, if not condoned, can mean break-in-service.

or to leave the office early.

CHAPTER 7
PERFORMANCE REVIEW
The effective use of manpower resources of any organization depends to a considerable degree,
upon an effective Performance Management Programme there. Evaluating people’s performance
is a complex process - which needs to be timely, fair, and consistent. Performance management
is a critical and effective tool in the development and optimization of human resources in
an organization. It helps people in the organization to consciously aim at improving upon the
individual performance and thus increase organizational effectiveness.
1. The process of performance appraisal will start with the exercise of distribution of Performance
appraisal forms of the employee to the concerned HOD every year during June or as and when
an employee completes his/her term either as a probationer or otherwise.
2. Employees who have completed a minimum six months of service are identified for
performance review.
3. Performance evaluation forms are written annually for the period from 1st July to 30th June
for permanent employees. HR Department will send the appraisal forms to TBSC employees
every year as per their schedule.
4. The Performance evaluation forms shall comprise of self-appraisal form (to be filled in by the
appraisee). The appraiser evaluation should be written by the reporting Manager immediately
superior to the employee concerned and reviewed by the next higher authority. In both cases,
they should have supervised the work for not less than three months. For computing of
three months, any leave for more than 15 days should be deducted. If the employee is under
suspension, he should write or review the reports within two months of date of suspension
or one month of the due date of completion of performance review forms, whichever is later.
If the employee concerned happens to be a relative, reporting or reviewing should be done by
the next higher authority.
5. The appraisee may be called by his/her supervisor for a performance review meeting where
the performance of the appraisee is discussed at length and the discussions recorded. The
appraisee is required to make an honest self-appraisal before discussing with the supervisor.
6. The assessment must be made on performance and behaviour on the job, which requires
specific facts to be recorded before arriving at a quantitative appraisal of the employee.
7. The Reviewing Manager/HOD may make recommendations regarding priorities based on the
performance of the person. It is mandatory for HOD to give at least THREE justifications for
their rating. While rating, there must be an attempt to differentiate the various members of
the team based on their performance.
IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 75
8. The performance evaluation forms compiled by HR Department are submitted to SEDC (Staff
Evaluation and Development Committee) or OEDC (Officer’s Evaluations and Development
Committee) for its review and recommendations
9. The SEDC/OEDC recommendations willbe implemented, subject to the Director’s approval.
PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL FOR MANAGERS - GUIDELINES
1. The performance of every Manager is appraised annually.
2. The appraisal aims at documenting
(i) the nature of work done,
(ii) quality of work done,
(iii) outstanding contribution made,
(iv) conditions under which various tasks have been performed,
(v) suggestions for improvements (appraisee’s as well as appraiser’s), and
(vi) developmental needs.
3. The appraisal aims at an assessment of the extent to which certain qualities (managerial
and behavioral) considered as desirable for effective functioning as an Manager at IIMA, are
exhibited by the candidate. Such an assessment, along with a performance review discussion
by each appraiser with the appraisee officer is expected to help the appraisee officer to
strengthen his competencies as an officer.
4. The annual performance appraisal of officers requires a high degree of involvement of the
officers in the form of listing his/her tasks, accomplishments, difficulties, developmental
needs, etc. and discussing with the appraiser support requirements, etc. during the review
period.
5. Based on the assessments made in the appraisal form, rewards (as and when applicable/
possible) and development decisions (training, field visits, job-rotation, etc.) may be taken from
time to time. Besides this, the appraisal process itself is intended to provide an opportunity
for improving one’s own effectiveness on the job through better planning, communication,
and insights about job-performance.

CHAPTER 8
PROMOTION POLICY
1. PREAMBLE
The Promotion Policy is a step in the direction of developing a comprehensive human resource
framework for the Institute. The Promotion Policy is one of the components of that framework
to specifically address the issue of promotion of employees. For the Promotion Policy to be
effective, it is important to develop a scientific appraisal system, staff training and development
programme and link them with the promotion. As promotion is a process of reward, incentive,
encouragement, appreciation of very good performance and enabling personal growth of an
employee, it is important that the Institute takes up the responsibility of institutionalizing staff
development and training so that the aspiration of the employee is balanced with the interest of
the Institute.
2. THE POLICY IN BRIEF (FOR GROUP B/C/D)
1. TShre. policy covers the following Levels:
Levels under 7th CPC Old GP under 6th CPC Group
No.
1 Level 1 1300/1650/1800 D
2 Level 2 1900 D/C
3 Level 3 2000 D

6 Level 6 4200 B
7 Level 7 4600 B
8 Level 8 4800 B
9 Level 9 5400 (non Manager) B
2. The policy is based on the principle of Seniority-cum-performance.
3. At the lowest level, the promotion is entirely based on seniority and merit, with
seniority getting reasonable weightage. At higher levels, merit and background gain
weightage.
IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 85
4. The policy is applicable up to the Level 9 for employees (other than permanent
research staff, academic associates and research staff).
th
5. The cut-off date for consideration is June 30 of every year, the date on which the
appraisal is done. So the period for consideration is July 1 to June 30.
6. The Promotion Exercise for staff will be conducted once in a year after receiving all
Performance Appraisal forms, normally between September - October.
7. In the case of professional and technical positions or other post present or to be created
in the future, which requires specific professional qualification and/or technical skills
the same will be filled up with employees who possess such professional qualification
or skill or technical competence. For recruitment and promotions to such posts
preference weightages, as and when permissible, for an internal candidate shall be
evolved, and the SEDC will finalize the criteria.
3. SOME IMPORTANT COMMON PROMOTION PARAMETERS FOR STAFF
PROMOTIONS:
1. Length of Service/ Seniority:
Seniority means the number of years spent by staff in
a particular substantive level/scale/position from the last promotion or DOJ (in case
of fresher). Two points are given for every year’s service. Every time a promotion is
.
granted, the seniority gained so far is nullified, and it starts afresh in the new level/
position
In a case where the internal examination is to be conducted for the promotion exercise
and one of the eligibility criteria to appear for such exercise is service in any level (e.g.
for promotion to Level 10 from Level 7 or Level 8 or Level 9 with minimum 5 years’
of service in the Institute) then in such cases one point for every year’s service will be
considered from the date of joining the minimum Level of eligibility and not from last
Annual Appraisal/ Merit:
promotion date.
2. Merit is one of the important components in the proposed
scheme of promotion. A staff member undergoes an annual performance appraisal.
This annual performance appraisal has a rating submitted by the supervisor. Merit
score is derived from the ratings received by individual staff members after each
year’s performance appraisal. The maximum points under merit will be 50 points.
Merit Score for the year= Performance Appraisal Score/10
Following is the conversion of the ratings of each year into points:
SEDC may normalize the score at the time of review, in case members feel that there is
too much variation in the score awarded by various supervisors.
In case, the employees’ promotion is delayed due to non-performance or any other
3. Educational Qualification:
reason, the performance appraisal score of last five years should be considered.
Institute has specified required qualifications for all
jobs. Apart from the qualification acquired at the time of joining, a staff member
may acquire an additional qualification during the period of consideration. For such
additional qualification, a maximum of ten points are earmarked for the purpose of
promotion. Depending on a candidate’s achievement in terms of qualifications, the
SEDC will grant him/her points from 0 to 10, as per the following:
86 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023
Sr. Qualification Points
1 Successful completion of any Master’s Degree. 10
2 Successful completion of any Graduation or any Post Graduate 08
Diploma of minimum duration of one year.
3 Successful completion of any Diploma course or any ITI or 06
professional course of minimum period of one year.
4 Successful completion of any Diploma / Certificate course or any 04
ITI course of minimum period of six months.
5 Training (1 point each for completing 5 days of training) 02

2. HR Department will maintain the scorecard for all employees coming under the
purview of this policy. HR Department will put up to SEDC all those cases where
st
an employee has completed required years of service on the date of review (1
July) after DOJ or date of last promotion (DOLP).
3. Based on the availability of vacancies, the selected candidate(s) shall be
considered for promotion by the Institute.
4. This exercise of promotion may be undertaken once in a year, most probably
during September – October. The effect of the promotion would be given from
the date as decided by the SEDC and based on vacancy available for promotion.
5. Any administrative delay in decision making may not have any bearing on the
effective dates as decided by SEDC.
6. An employee who is unable to get promotion in a particular year after he has
been considered by the Committee will have to wait until the next year when
a similar exercise is undertaken. In such cases, there will be loss of seniority
of one year. SEDC may decide to waive this off if the reason for holding back
promotion was other than merit.
7. Those employees who intend to know their score will be informed of the
score earned every year after the process of awarding the promotion has been
completed.
8. Any employee whose rating on merit parameter in a particular year is appraised
as poor, shall be informed about it and allowed to represent his/her case to the
SEDC for review.
IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 87
9. In case of awarding financial upgradation/ promotion to the employees near
to their retirement, employees retiring within 12 months’ period from the date
th
of completion of promotion cycle (i.e. 30 June) can be considered for such
purpose with relaxation in promotion criteria, provided they have performed
very well and obtained appropriate score in last five years.
4. PROMOTION POLICY (FINANCIAL UPGRADATION) FOR EXISTING GROUP D
EMPLOYEES:
For existing Group D employees, the promotion is either through Personal Promotion (PP), Special
Promotion (SP), Special Review One (SR-1) or Special Review Two (SR-2). As per the existing
policy, the type of promotion depends on the number of years an individual has completed at the
Institute from the date of joining. PP, SP, SR-1, and SR-2 is given to the employee, if the employee
has completed 8, 16, 27 and 33/35 years respectively from the date of joining (DOJ) or as revised
th
from time to time. Now, as all existing Group D employees who were in 6 CPC GP 1300 and GP
1650 have been moved to Level 1 (GP 1800) irrespective of their service, the personal promotion
which was available at GP 1650 on completion of 8 years of service in GP 1300 has been removed
from the new policy. In the given circumstances, SEDC has introduced GP 2000 in Group C, special
promotion-2 at GP 2000 with 20 years of service from the date of joining. So, now for existing
Group D employees SP-1, SP-2, SR-1, and SR-2 are available to the employee if the employee has
completed 10, 20, 27 and 33/35 years respectively from the date of joining (DOJ).
SEDC will consider following promotion criteria for financial upgradation of Group D employees:
Sr. Particulars Max. points
1 Length of Service/Seniority 20
2 Annual Appraisal 50
3 SEDC review / interactions 30
Total 100
Every year HR Department needs to submit the list of Group D employees, to review the cases for
such promotions. SEDC may review the individual cases and decide on the promotion. Following
conditions needs to be taken into consideration for Special Promoti“ovne royf Ggorooudp” D employees:
1. The staff member under consideration should have obtained a cumulative score
during the last five assessment years and should have a track record of excellent service in the

2. He should not have indulged in any serious indiscipline at the Institute.
3. The staff member may be moved from one section to another, depending on the need of
the Institute. Such staff members may also be required to undergo relevant training as per
present or future requirements of the Institute.
88 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023
4. Financial upgradation under the scheme shall be allowed in the immediate next higher level
pay in the hierarchy of revised levels as per the policy of the Institute.
5. Financial upgradation would be on non-functional basis (i.e. Group D employee is categorised
as Group D only) subject to eligibility and within the Group.
6. As such there shall be no additional financial upgradation for the senior employee on the
ground that the junior employee in the level has got higher pay under the Scheme. If the
senior employee remains on LWP or/and does not enhance the education qualification, then
possible that a junior employee may get an advantage compared to a senior employee.

should mention the amount of expenditure incurred by the employee towards lodging
and boarding in the residential complex. In case such certificate cannot be obtained, self-
attested copy of the report card and original fee receipts (including e-receipts) which should
indicate the amount of expenditure incurred by the employe towards lodging and boarding
in the residential complex can be produced for claiming Hostel Subsidy. The expenditure on
boarding and lodging or the ceiling of Rs. 6750/- as mentioned above, whichever is lower,
shall be paid to the employee as Hostel Subsidy.
5. The reimbursement of Children Education Allowance for Divyaang children of employees
shall be payable at the double the normal rates of CEA prescribed above in clause (b) i.e. Rs.
4500/- per month (fixed).
6. The above rates/ceiling would be automatically raised by 25 % every time the Dearness
Allowance on the revised pay structure goes by 50%.
7. Under this Scheme, one can avail the benefit up to a maximum of 2 children.
8. Hostel subsidy is applicable only in respect of the child studying in a residential educational
institution located at least 50 kilometers from the residence of the employee.
9. The upper age limit for Divyaang children has been set at 22 years. In the case of other
children, the age limit will be 20 years or till the time of passing 12th class whichever is
earlier. There shall be no minimum age.
10. CEA is allowed in case of children studying through “Correspondence or Distance Learning”
subject to other conditions laid down herein.
11. The CEA and Hostel Subsidy is admissible in respect of children studying from two classes
before class one to 12th standard and also for the initial two years of a diploma/certificate
course from Polytechnic/ITI/Engineering College, if the child pursues the course after passing
10th standard, and the employee has not been granted CEA/ Hostel Subsidy in respect of the
child for studies in 11th and 12th standards.
12. The Children Education Allowance or hostel subsidy shall be applicable to the employee while
he is on duty or is under suspension or is on leave (including extra ordinary leave). Provided
that during any period which is treated as ‘dies non’ the employee will not be eligible for the
CEA/Hostel subsidy for that period.
13. Reimbursement, as indicated above, will be applicable for expenditure on the education of
school-going children only i.e., for children from nursery to twelfth class, including classes
eleventh and twelfth held by junior colleges or schools affiliated to Universities or Boards of
Education.
126 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023
14. The reimbursement of Children Education Allowance shall have no connection with the
performance of the child in his/her class. In other words, even if a child fails in a particular
class, the reimbursement of Children Education Allowance shall be granted.
15. Under this scheme, reimbursement will be done once a year, after completion of the financial
year.
16. In case the spouse of the Institute employee is a Government servant, only one of them can
avail the reimbursement under the scheme subject to production of the certificate from the
employer of the spouse that he is not claiming reimbursement under the scheme or in any
other form.
17. Reimbursement can be made on the submission of the certificate issued by the Head of the
Institution for the period/year for which claim has been preferred. The certificate should
confirm that the child studied in the school during the previous academic year. In case such
certificate cannot be obtained, self-attested copy of the report card or self-attested fee receipt
(s) [including e-receipts] confirming/indicating that the fee deposited for the entire academic
year can be produced as a supporting document to claim CEA.
The provisions are effective from July 1, 2017 onwards.
